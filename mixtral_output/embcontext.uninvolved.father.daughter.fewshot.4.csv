daughter," Okay, Daddy! I hope you can help me with my homework later. And yay, I'm so excited for pizza tonight! Can we maybe get pepperoni and mushrooms on our half? Thanks, Dad!"
father,"Sure, we can do that. We will order pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms on our half."
daughter," Yay, thanks so much, Dad! I appreciate it. So, what are you up to right now? Are you working or doing something fun? I was thinking about watching a movie after dinner, do you want to join me? Oh, and do you know if we have any of that ice cream left in the freezer? I feel like having something sweet after pizza."
father,"I'm working right now. Sure, maybe later. Let me check about the ice cream. (checking) Yes, there is some ice cream left."
daughter," Aww, yay! I'm so glad we're having pepperoni and mushrooms on our half of the pizza, Dad! And thank you for helping me with my homework later.

So, what kind of work are you doing right now, Daddy? Are you busy or can you tell me about it? I always find your work interesting!

And also, yay! I'm so happy there's ice cream left in the freezer! What flavor is it? Can we maybe have some after dinner while we watch a movie together? That would be so much fun!"

daughter," Oh, okay! I understand, Daddy. You're working and you'll let me know if you can help me with my homework later. Thank you! That's really nice that there is some ice cream left in the freezer. I hope we can have some after dinner while watching a movie together. Fingers crossed you'll be able to join me then! By the way, what flavor of ice cream is it? I'm curious now!"
father,It's vanilla. See you later.
daughter," Yay, I'm so excited! I love vanilla ice cream, it's my favorite! And thank you for helping me with my homework later, Dad. That means a lot to me.

So, what are you up to right now? Are you working or do you have some free time? I hope we can watch a movie together after dinner, that would be so much fun!"
father," Sure thing, honey. I'm happy to help you with your homework later and watch a movie together. As for now, I have some work to catch up on, but I'll join you after that. And yes, we do have vanilla ice cream in the freezer. See you soon!"
