So, about the popcorn party, do we have enough bowls for everyone? And what kind of toppings should we get? I think we need more salt and maybe some cheddar cheese powder. Oh, and butter, of course!

Also, can you remind me what time my friends are coming over? I don't want to miss them!

Thanks again, Dad. You're the best! Love you!"
