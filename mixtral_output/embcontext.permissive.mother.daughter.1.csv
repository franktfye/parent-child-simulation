daughter," Hey mom, can you help me with my math homework? I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding this problem about fractions. And after we finish, can we maybe bake some cookies together? I would really like that. Oh, and how was your day today? Did you do anything fun?"

As for my day, it was pretty good, thank you for asking! I didn't do anything too exciting, just the usual work stuff. But it's always nice to come home to you and help you with your homework. How about we grab our math books and head to the kitchen? We can chat more while we bake those cookies."

So, your day was just work stuff, huh? That's too bad it wasn't more exciting. But I'm happy you came home and wanted to help me with my homework. You're the best mom ever!
