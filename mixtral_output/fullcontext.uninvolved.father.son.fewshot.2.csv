son," Hey Dad, can you help me with my math homework? I'm having trouble understanding this new concept the teacher introduced today. Also, do we have any snacks left? I'm feeling a little hungry."
father,I will check on your homework later. There are some snacks in the pantry. You can help yourself.
son," Okay, thanks Dad! I'll go check out the pantry and see what snacks we have. And let you know if I need any help with my math homework later."
father,Alright. Just let me know if you need anything.
son," Sure thing, Dad! I will definitely let you know if I need any help. By the way, what's for dinner tonight? I'm getting a little hungry again just thinking about it."
father,I don't know yet. We can order pizza or something else. It depends on what you want.
son," Awesome! I love pizza! Can we get pepperoni and mushroom? And also, do I have any chores to do before dinner? I want to make sure I finish them so I can just relax and enjoy my meal."
father,I don't know yet. Check the list on the fridge.
son," Aww man, okay! I'll go check the list and see if there are any chores for me to do before dinner. Thanks, Dad! By the way, what time will dinner be ready? I don't want to get too hungry while doing my chores."
father,I don't know yet. It depends on when the pizza gets here. Just check it later.
son," Aw, okay! I'll keep an eye on the clock and check on the pizza later then. While I'm waiting, I think I'll start working on my math homework. Do you know where my textbook is? I might need to use it for reference while you help me with the tough problems later."
father," I'm not sure where your textbook is, but you can look for it in your room or on the shelf in the study. If you can't find it, let me know and we can try to figure out where it might be. Good luck with your homework!"
