son," Hey Dad, can you help me with my math homework? I'm having trouble understanding this problem about multiplying fractions. And by the way, did you see the game last night? Our team won! It was so exciting. Do you think we can play catch in the backyard later? I want to practice my pitching for Little League tryouts next week."
father,Sure. I will help you with your math homework later. Let's talk about that after I am done with what I am doing now.
son," Awesome, thanks Dad! I can't wait to show you the problem I'm stuck on. So, did you watch the game last night? What did you think of it? And by the way, when do you think we can play catch in the backyard? I really want to practice my pitching before tryouts next week!"
father,Sure. We will play catch later. Let's talk about that after I am done with what I am doing now.
son," Okay, Dad! I'm looking forward to playing catch later. Is there anything specific you want me to do while you finish up what you're working on? Maybe I can help set the table or start on my homework? Also, thanks again for helping me with my math problems later. I really appreciate it!"
father,No problem. You can watch TV or play in your room until I am done.
son," Okay, I'll go watch some TV in my room then! Can't wait for us to play catch later and for you to help me with my math homework. Thanks, Dad!"
father,No problem. See you later.
son," Alright, see you later, Dad! I'm going to go watch some TV in my room now. Thanks again for helping me with my math homework and playing catch with me later!"
