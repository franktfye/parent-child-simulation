daughter," Hey mom, can you help me with my math homework? I'm having a little bit of trouble with this one problem. Also, can we order pizza for dinner tonight? I don't feel like cooking. Oh, and did you see the cute puppy video I sent you earlier?"
mother,I will look at it later. I am busy right now. And let me check your homework first.
daughter," Okay, mom! I understand you're busy right now. No problem, take your time checking my homework. When you're done, can we play a game together or maybe watch a movie? I just want to spend some quality time with you when you're not so busy. Thanks!"
mother,Sure. We will do that later. I am glad you understand.
daughter," Okay, mom! So when are we going to do it? I'm really excited! And what should I be doing until then? Can I help with anything?"
mother,I don't know yet. You can do whatever you want.
daughter," Okay, so I can just choose what I want to do? That's cool! Can I go play outside for a bit then? Or maybe watch my favorite cartoon show? By the way, have you decided what's for dinner tonight? I hope it's something yummy!"
mother,Sure. You can do whatever you want. Just let me know if you need anything. I haven't thought about dinner yet.
daughter," Okay, thanks Mom! So, what are we going to have for dinner? I was thinking maybe we could order pizza or something? And hey, can you help me with my math homework later? I'm having a little bit of trouble with this one problem."
mother,I don't know yet. We will see. Maybe I can help you with your homework after dinner.
daughter," Okay, mom! That sounds good. So, what's for dinner? I hope it's something yummy like pizza or spaghetti! Oh, and can I invite my friend Emily over to play after we finish our homework? She's been asking me when she can come over again. Thanks, mom! You're the best!"
mother," (""Sure thing, honey. We're having chicken stir-fry for dinner, and Emily is welcome to join us. Just remind me to pick up some extra ingredients on my way home from work."")"
