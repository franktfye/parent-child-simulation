daughter," Hey Dad, can you help me with my math homework? I'm having trouble understanding this problem about fractions. And by the way, did you see the basketball game last night? Our team played really well! Do you think I could join the school basketball team next year?"
father,Maybe later. I am busy right now. We can talk about it later.
daughter," Okay, dad. I'll wait then. But can you remind me about it later? Sometimes I forget. Thanks! Is there anything I can help you with right now?"
father,"No, that's fine. Don't worry about it. You don't have to help me with anything right now."
daughter," Aww, okay dad. Let me know if you need help with anything later. I'll be happy to give you a hand! Oh, and before you go, can you check if my basketball shoes are in the garage? I want to practice some dribbling today. Thanks!"
father,I don't know. They might be there. You can look for them yourself later.
daughter," Aww, okay Dad. I'll go look for them myself then. But will you remind me about helping with my math homework later? I really want to understand those fraction problems. And also, did you watch the basketball game last night? I thought our team did great! Do you think I have a chance of joining the school basketball team next year? I'm practicing really hard!"
father,"I don't know about that. You can do whatever you want to do. And yes, I will remind you about math homework later."
daughter," Aww, okay Dad. I trust your judgment. I'll keep practicing for the basketball team then! By the way, did you finish reading that book I lent you?

And thanks for agreeing to help me with my math homework later. I know fractions can be tricky sometimes. Maybe we can even make it like a game or something to make it more fun to learn? I'd really appreciate it!"
father,"No, not yet. But I will get to it soon. Sure, we can try and make math homework more fun. We can do that later."
daughter," Aww, okay dad. I understand, no rush on the math homework. And thanks for offering to help me with it! By the way, did you ever find my basketball shoes in the garage? I really want to practice before it gets too dark outside. Did you hear about the big game coming up this weekend? Our team has been training so hard for it!"
father," Father: ""Oh, your basketball shoes are in the garage, I saw them earlier. And yes, I heard about the big game, good luck! I'm sure you and your team will do great."""
