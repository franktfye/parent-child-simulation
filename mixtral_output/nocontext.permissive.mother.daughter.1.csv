daughter," Hey mom, can you help me with my math homework? I'm having a little bit of trouble understanding this problem about fractions. And after we're done, can we maybe bake some cookies together? I think it would be fun!"
mother," Of course, sweetie! I'd be happy to help you with your math homework. Let's take a look at that fraction problem together and see if we can figure it out.

daughter," Yay, thanks mom! I knew you were the best at math! Okay, let me go get my math book. Hey, can we make chocolate chip cookies? Those are my favorite! And maybe we can listen to some music while we bake? That sounds like a fun idea, don't you think?"
