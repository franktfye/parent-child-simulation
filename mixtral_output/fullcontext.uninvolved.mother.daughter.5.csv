daughter," Hey mom, can you help me with my math homework? I'm having trouble understanding this new concept we learned today. Also, what's for dinner tonight? I'm really craving some pizza!"
mother," Sure thing, sweetie. I can try to help you with your math homework. Just give me a minute to look it over. As for dinner, I was thinking of making something simple like pasta or sandwiches. I'm afraid we don't have pizza tonight. But maybe we can order some this weekend as a treat?"
daughter," Aw man, I was really hoping for pizza tonight! Okay, I'll wait for you to look at my math homework. Can you explain it to me in a simple way so I can understand it better? And pasta sounds good too, but can we maybe make it with some cheese? Yum!"
mother," Sure thing, honey. I'll do my best to explain the math concept in a simple way. And of course we can add some cheese to the pasta. I'm sure that will make it even more delicious! Just give me a few minutes to go over your homework and figure out the best way to explain it."
daughter," Okay, thanks mom! I appreciate your help with my math homework. And yay, cheese on the pasta sounds so good! I'll be ready to start working on it once you are. In the meantime, can you tell me what kind of cheese we have? I love all kinds of cheese but I think melted mozzarella would be amazing on the pasta!"
mother," Sure thing, honey. I'll go check and see what kind of cheese we have in the fridge. Just give me a moment. In the meantime, I hope I can help you understand that new math concept better. Let's take it one step at a time, shall we?"
daughter," Yay, thanks mom! I can't wait to see what kind of cheese we have. And don't worry, I know we can figure out this math homework together. Just start with the first step and go from there, okay? I'm ready when you are!"
mother," Sure thing, sweetie. I'll go check on the cheese now. Let's get started on your math homework. The first step is to understand the problem. Can you tell me what the problem is asking for? Just take your time and we'll work through it together."
daughter," Okay, thanks mom! So the problem I'm stuck on is about solving for x in this equation: 3x + 5 = 20. Can you help me figure out how to isolate x so I can find the answer? Thanks, I really appreciate your help!"
mother," Of course, honey. In order to solve for x, we first need to get x by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to get rid of the 5 on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation. That will give us:

3x = 15

Do you see how I did that? Now, in order to solve for x, we just need to divide both sides of the equation by 3. Can you try doing that on your own and see what you get for the value of x? Just take it one step at a time and don't worry if you don't get it right away. We can always go back and check our work if we need to."
daughter," Yay, I think I got it! So if I divide both sides of the equation by 3, then x equals 5, right? Thanks so much for helping me with this, mom. I don't know what I would do without you! And I'm really excited to see what kind of cheese we have for the pasta now. Can we go check it out together?"
mother," Sure thing, honey. I'm glad I could help you with your math homework and that you were able to figure it out. And of course we can go check out the cheese for the pasta together. Just let me put away your math books and then we can head to the kitchen. I think we have a few different kinds of cheese to choose from, so you can pick which one you want to use. Let's get started on making dinner now, shall we?"
