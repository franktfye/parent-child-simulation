son," Hey Dad, can you help me with my math homework? I'm having trouble understanding this problem about fractions. And by the way, did you see the game last night? Our team won! Do you think we can go out for ice cream later as a treat for doing well in school?"
father,"Sure, I will help you with your homework. No, I didn't watch the game. And about ice cream, maybe some other time."
son," Aww, okay dad. I was really looking forward to some ice cream. But thanks for helping me with my homework! Do you want me to show you the problem I'm having trouble with?"
father,"No, that's alright. You can do it on your own. I trust you."
son," Aw, thanks for the vote of confidence, Dad! But are you sure you don't want to see the problem? I might be making a silly mistake or something. Anyways, how was your day today? Did anything interesting happen at work?"
father,It was fine. Nothing special. How about yours? Did you have a good day at school?
son," Yeah, I had a pretty good day at school today! We learned some new things in science and played a fun game in P.E. But right now, I'm really stuck on this math problem about fractions. Can you please take a look at it and see if you can help me understand how to solve it?"
father,"No, that's alright. You can do it on your own. I trust you."
son," Aww, okay dad. I'll give it another try. But if I'm still having trouble, can I come back and ask for your help? And by the way, what's for dinner tonight? I'm getting kind of hungry!"
father,I don't know yet. We will see later. You can figure it out on your own.
son," Aww, okay dad. I'll try my best to figure it out then. But if I can't, can I still come ask you for help? And what should I do until dinner? Should I start on my other homework or maybe go play outside for a bit?"
father," Sure, you can come ask me for help if you need it. As for what to do until dinner, it's up to you. Do whatever you want. I trust your judgment."
