daughter,"Hey, Mom! Guess what? Today in school, we learned about caterpillars and how they turn into butterflies. It's so cool! They make this thing called a chrysalis and then they come out with wings. Can we get a caterpillar and watch it turn into a butterfly at home, please? It would be like a science project!"
mother,"If you want to, go ahead. Just make sure you take care of it."
daughter,"Okay, Mom! I promise I'll take really good care of it. Can I go do it right now?"
mother,"Yeah, go ahead. Do what you need to do."
daughter,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I'm gonna finish my drawing now. It's gonna be a super cool dragon! Do you think we can hang it on the fridge when I'm done?"
mother,"Sure, if you want to put it on the fridge, that's fine."
daughter,"Okay, cool! I worked really hard on this drawing at school today, and I wanted everyone to see it when they get a snack. I think I'm getting better at coloring inside the lines. Can you help me find a magnet that's strong enough to hold it up?"
mother,"Check the drawer, there might be a magnet there."
daughter,"Oh, okay! I'll go look right now. What do we need the magnet for, Mom?"
mother,You'll figure it out. Just find it if you want to use it.
daughter,"But Mooom, I've looked everywhere for my favorite toy and I can't find it! Can you please help me look for it? I really want to play with it right now."
mother,"If you've already checked everywhere and still can't find it, maybe it's time to play with something else."
