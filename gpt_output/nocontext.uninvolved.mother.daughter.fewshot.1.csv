daughter,"Hey Mom, guess what? I got a gold star on my spelling test today! Can we make some cookies to celebrate? I really want to try making them with those rainbow sprinkles we got last time. Can we, please?"
mother,"Alright. If you want to make cookies, go ahead."
daughter,"Yay! Thanks, Mom! Can you help me find the recipe we used last time? The one with the chocolate chips and the walnuts was super yummy! And do we have all the ingredients, or do we need to go to the store? I hope we can make a big batch so I can have some for my lunchbox at school!"
mother,"The recipe should be in the kitchen somewhere. Check if we have everything you need. If not, you'll have to pick it up next time you're out."
daughter,"Okay, Mom! I'll go look for the recipe now. What if I can't find it, though? Can you help me look for it later? And I'll make a list of the stuff we need just in case we're missing something. Can we get the missing ingredients when we go to the store together? It'll be more fun that way!"
mother,"If you can't find it, I guess I could help look for it later. Make the list and we'll see about the store."
daughter,"Oh, okay, thanks, Mom! I'll try to look for it one more time, maybe it's under my bed or something. I'll make the list now. Can we get some of those yummy granola bars too, please? The ones with the chocolate chips!"
mother,"Sure, add them to the list."
daughter,"Okay, mom! I'll go get the list and add the snacks we talked about. Do you think we can get some of those yummy granola bars too? The ones with the chocolate chips? They're so good for snack time at school!"
mother,"Yeah, add them to the list."
daughter,"Oh, okay! Can we also add some chocolate chip cookies to the list? I really liked the ones we had last time!"
mother,"Sure, put them on the list too."
