daughter,"Hey Mom, guess what happened at school today? We had a surprise quiz in math, and I think I did really well! Also, can we have spaghetti for dinner tonight? I've been craving it all day!"
mother,That's good. Make yourself some spaghetti if you want.
daughter,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I think I'll make the spaghetti with the tomato sauce we got the other day. Do we still have some of that cheese to sprinkle on top? It's super yummy with it!"
mother,"Yeah, there should be some cheese in the fridge."
daughter,"Awesome! I'll go check. Oh, and can you help me when I boil the pasta? I wanna make sure it comes out perfect this time!"
mother,You can handle it. Just follow the instructions on the package.
daughter,"Okay, I'll give it a try! But can you just stay nearby, just in case I have any questions? I really want to get it right."
mother,"Alright, I'll be around. Just call if you really need something."
daughter,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I'll shout if I need help. I'm going to get the water boiling now. Oh, and how much salt should I put in the water?"
mother,Just a pinch. You'll figure it out.
daughter,"Okay, just a pinch. Got it! I'll do my best. Hey, can you remind me how long I should let the spaghetti cook? I don't want it to be all mushy."
mother,"Usually, it's about 8 to 10 minutes, but just taste it after 8 minutes and see if it's to your liking."
