daughter,"Hey Mom, can we make some cookies together later? I really liked the last ones we made, and I want to try adding chocolate chips this time!"
mother,Do whatever you think is best.
daughter,"Okay, Mom! I think I'll spend a little bit of time on my homework and then take a break to play outside before it gets dark. Is that alright?"
mother,"Yeah, that's fine. Do what you think is best."
daughter,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I'll make sure to get my math problems done first, and then I'll go for a bike ride. Oh, and when we make the cookies, can we use the big chocolate chips? They're my favorite!"
mother,"Yeah, sure. Use whatever chocolate chips you like."
daughter,"Yay, thanks, Mom! I'm so excited! I'll make sure to finish my homework super fast so we have lots of time for cookie making. Oh, and can we maybe add some walnuts too? I think that would taste super yummy with the chocolate chips!"
mother,Do what you want with the cookies. Just clean up after.
daughter,"Okay, Mom! I promise I'll clean up everything after we make the cookies. I'll even put all the dishes in the dishwasher. It's gonna be so much fun! Can we start after I finish my homework?"
mother,"Yeah, sure. Do your homework first."
daughter,"Okay, Mom! I'll get started on my homework right away. I'll do my best to focus so I can get it all done and then have some fun outside! Thanks!"
mother,"Alright, have fun with your homework and the bike ride. We can make the cookies when you're back."
