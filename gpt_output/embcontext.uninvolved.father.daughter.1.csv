daughter,"Hey Dad, what's up? Did you see my drawing from art class today? I tried to draw that superhero you told me stories about! Can we hang it on the fridge?"
father,"Oh, hey there. No, I haven't seen your drawing yet. If you want to hang it on the fridge, go ahead. Sounds like you had fun drawing it."
daughter,"Yeah, I had a lot of fun! I used all the colors you got me for my birthday. I'll show you the drawing after dinner, okay? Can we also play with my soccer ball at the park this weekend? I've been practicing my kicks!"
father,"Oh, that's good. Use whatever you need. After dinner works. About the park, sure, if you want to go this weekend, that's fine. Just remind me when it's time to go."
daughter,"Awesome! I'll definitely remind you. I can't wait to show you how much better I've gotten at soccer. And guess what? I even made a drawing of us playing soccer in the park! I think you're gonna like it. After dinner, we can put it up on the fridge next to the grocery list so we won't forget about going to the park!"
father,"Oh, that sounds nice. We can put the drawing on the fridge later. Enjoy your time until dinner then."
daughter,Okay! I'll go get my crayons and add some more details to it before we put it up. Maybe I can draw a little soccer ball in the corner too! I can't wait for you to see it. See you at dinner!
father,"Alright, sounds like a plan. Have fun with your drawing. See you at dinner."
daughter,"Thanks, Dad! I'm gonna make it super colorful. Oh, and can we have spaghetti for dinner? It's my favorite! See you soon!"
father,"Sure, spaghetti is fine. We can have that for dinner. See you later."
