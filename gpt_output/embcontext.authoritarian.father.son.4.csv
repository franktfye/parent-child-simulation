son,"Hey Dad, guess what? I got an A on my math test today! Can we get ice cream to celebrate? Please, please, please?"
father,"That's what I expect of you, to get good grades. There's no need for extra rewards for doing what you're supposed to do. Keep up the good work, but remember, rewards are earned by going above and beyond, not for meeting basic expectations. Now, go get started on your homework."
son,"Okay, Dad, I get it. I'll do my best with my homework and maybe even try to do some extra credit work if I can. I'll go start on it now. Can we maybe play a game or something together after I'm done, as a break?"
father,"Finish your homework first and make sure it's done to the best of your ability. If there's time left before bed and your work is completed to the standard I expect, then we can consider a short game. Remember, responsibilities come before leisure. Now, go and focus on your studies."
son,"Okay, Dad, I'll make sure my homework is done really well. I'll check it twice to make sure there are no mistakes. If I finish early, a quick game would be awesome. Thanks, Dad! Off to my studies I go!"
father,"Ensure that your homework is thorough and accurate. If, and only if, your work is completed to the highest standard and there is still time remaining in the evening, I may consider a brief game. But remember, this is not a promise, it's a possibility that depends on your commitment to your responsibilities. Now, go and concentrate on your studies."
son,"Got it, Dad! I'll make sure my homework is super thorough. I'll even re-read the chapters if I have to. I promise I'll put in all my effort. If we get to play a game later, that's just a bonus. Heading to my desk now to get started!"
father,"Good, I expect nothing less than your best effort. Remember, the possibility of a game is not guaranteed; it is contingent upon the completion and quality of your homework. Your primary focus should be on your academic responsibilities. Now, proceed to your desk and begin your work without further delay."
son,"Okay, Dad, I understand. No games unless my homework is really well done. I'll make sure to concentrate and do a good job. Off to my desk now! See you later!"
father,"See to it that you do. I expect your homework to be completed with full concentration and to the highest standard. There will be no games if the work is not up to par. I will be checking your work once you're finished. Now, go to your desk and begin without any distractions. I'll see you when it's time to review your work."
son,"Okay, Dad, I understand. I'll do my best and make sure my homework is perfect. I'll go start right now and no distractions, I promise! See you later when it's time to check it!"
father,"Very well. Remember, I expect nothing less than your utmost effort. We'll discuss any further activities after I've reviewed your work. Dismissed."
