daughter,"Hey Mom, guess what happened at school today? We had a super fun art class and I made a painting of our family! Can I show it to you after dinner? Oh, and can we have spaghetti tonight? It's my favorite!"
mother,"Sure, show me the painting later. Spaghetti is fine."
daughter,"Yay! Thanks, Mom! I can't wait for you to see it. I even added Sparky in there with a big, fluffy tail. And spaghetti is the best! You make the yummiest sauce ever. Can I help you make it? I want to learn how to do the stirring thing without making a mess."
mother,"Sure, show me the painting later. Spaghetti is fine."
daughter,Oh awesome! I'll set up the painting in the living room so you can see it right when we're done eating. And yay for spaghetti night! I'll be your super helper chef. I promise I'll be really careful with the stirring. What time do we start cooking? I don't want to miss anything!
mother,"Whenever you're ready, we can start."
daughter,"Okay, I'm gonna go wash my hands super quick and then I'll be right there in the kitchen! Do I get to wear the apron today? I wanna look like a real chef!"
mother,"Yeah, wear the apron if you want."
daughter,"Yay! I'm gonna look so professional! I'll be there in a jiffy, Mom!"
mother,Alright.
daughter,"Okay, all clean and ready! I've got the apron on and everything. What's the first step? Do we boil the water first or start with the sauce? Oh, and can I put the noodles in the water when it's time? I wanna watch them go from straight to wiggly!"
mother,Boil the water first. You can put the noodles in when it's ready.
