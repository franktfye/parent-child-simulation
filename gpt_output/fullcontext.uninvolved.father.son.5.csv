son,Hey Dad! Can we go to the park later? I really want to try out my new soccer ball with you!
father,"Sure, if you want to go to the park, that's fine. Just make sure you're back before it gets dark. Have fun with your new soccer ball."
son,"Awesome! Thanks, Dad! I'll make sure to watch the time. Do you think you can come with me for a little bit and show me some of your cool soccer moves?"
father,"Oh, you know, I'm not really up for playing soccer. But you go ahead and enjoy yourself. Maybe you can find a friend at the park to kick the ball around with."
son,"Aw, okay, Dad. I was really hoping you'd come play, but it's alright. Maybe I'll see if Jamie can come to the park too. He's pretty good at soccer. Can I have a snack before I go? I think I need some energy for all the running I'm gonna do!"
father,"Yeah, grab whatever you find in the kitchen. Just don't spoil your dinner. Have a good time at the park."
son,"Okay, I'll just grab an apple or something. Thanks, Dad! I'll be back before dinner for sure. See you later!"
father,"Alright, see you later. Be safe."
son,"Okay, I will! I'll be careful and stay where there are lots of people. Bye, Dad!"
father,Bye.
son,"Bye, Dad! I'll tell you all about it when I get back!"
father,Alright.
