daughter,"Hey Mom, can we make some cookies together this weekend? I really liked the ones we made last time, and I want to try adding chocolate chips in them! Oh, and can Sarah come over to help too? It'll be so much fun!"
mother,"Do whatever you want. If you want to invite Sarah, that's fine."
daughter,"Oh, really? Yay! Thanks, Mom! I'll call her right now and tell her she can come over. Do we have any of those chocolate chip cookies left? Sarah loves them!"
mother,"Yeah, there should be some left in the kitchen. Help yourself."
daughter,"Awesome, thanks! I'll grab a couple for us to munch on while I call her. Oh, and Mom, do we have all the ingredients for the cookies, or do we need to pick up anything from the store?"
mother,"Check the kitchen for what you need. If something's missing, you'll have to pick it up."
daughter,"Okay, I'll go check the pantry now. If we don't have everything, can we go to the store together later? I want to make sure we get the best chocolate chips!"
mother,"If you want to go to the store, that's fine. Make a list of what you need."
daughter,"Okay, I'll make a list after I check what we have. I hope we can find those really yummy chocolate chips like the ones in the commercials. I'll be right back after I see what we need!"
mother,Alright. Let me know if you need money for the store.
daughter,"Oh, thanks, Mom! I'll take a look at my piggy bank first, but I might need a little extra. I'll let you know after I check the pantry and make the list!"
mother,"Sure, just come to me if you find you're short on cash. Have fun with your baking."
