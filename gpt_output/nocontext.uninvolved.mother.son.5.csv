son,"Hey Mom, guess what happened at school today! We had an art class and I made a really cool painting. Can I show it to you when you're not busy? Oh, and can we get some ice cream later? Please?"
mother,"Sure, you can show me the painting whenever. About the ice cream, if you want some, you can grab it from the freezer, or if we're out, maybe you can pick some up next time you're at the store."
son,"Oh, awesome! I'll bring my painting down in a bit, I think you're gonna like it! And yaaay, ice cream! I'll check the freezer. If we don't have any, can we get chocolate flavor next time? It's my favorite!"
mother,"Sure, you can show me the painting whenever. And about the ice cream, if there's none in the freezer, we can pick up chocolate flavor next time we're at the store."
son,"Oh, awesome! Thanks, Mom! I think you're gonna really like the painting this time. I used all the colors you gave me. And for the ice cream, can we maybe get chocolate chip? It's my favorite! Oh, and can we maybe go to the store after my soccer practice tomorrow? I could really use some ice cream as a post-practice treat!"
mother,"Yeah, sure, we can get chocolate chip ice cream. And about going to the store after soccer practice, that's fine. Just remind me tomorrow, okay?"
son,"Yay, chocolate chip is the best! Thanks, Mom! I'll definitely remind you tomorrow after practice. Can we maybe get some toppings too, like sprinkles or whipped cream? It would be like making our own sundaes at home!"
mother,"Sure, if that's what you want. Just grab whatever toppings you like from the store after practice."
son,"Oh, awesome! Thanks, Mom! Can I get pepperoni and lots of cheese? And maybe some mushrooms too? I'm gonna make the best pizza ever! Do you think we could get some ice cream for dessert as well? I promise I'll finish my homework before I start cooking!"
mother,"Sure, get whatever toppings you like for the pizza. Ice cream sounds fine too. Just make sure you do finish your homework before you start cooking."
son,"Oh, yay! Thanks, Mom! I'll put pepperoni and lots of cheese on my pizza. And for the ice cream, can we get chocolate chip? It's my favorite! I promise I'll get all my homework done first. Can I do my homework in the kitchen so I can smell the pizza while I work? It'll make me do it faster, I bet!"
mother,"Yeah, alright. Do your homework wherever you want. Just don't make a mess, and remember to turn off the oven when you're done with the pizza."
