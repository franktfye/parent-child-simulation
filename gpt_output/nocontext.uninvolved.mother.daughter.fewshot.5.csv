daughter,"Hey Mom, can we bake some cookies together later? I really loved it when we made the chocolate chip ones last time. They were so yummy! Plus, I want to try using the cookie cutters we got for my birthday. Can we, please?"
mother,"Sure, if you want to bake some cookies, go ahead."
daughter,"Yay! Thanks, Mom! Can we make chocolate chip cookies? And can I help with mixing the dough? It's so much fun! Oh, and can we use the fun cookie cutters, too? I want to make some that are shaped like stars and hearts!"
mother,Do whatever you like with the cookies. Just clean up after.
daughter,"Okay, Mommy! I'm gonna make a super-duper cookie tower! I'll make sure to clean up all the crumbs and put the cookie jar back when I'm done. Can I have some milk with the cookies too, please?"
mother,"Yeah, milk is in the fridge. Clean up when you're done."
daughter,"Okay, Mom! I'll make sure to put everything away when I'm finished. Thanks for the milk! Do we have any cookies to go with it?"
mother,Check the pantry. There might be some left.
daughter,"Oh, okay! I'll go look right now. I really hope there's some left because I've been craving it all day!"
mother,"Yeah, check the fridge."
daughter,"Oh, okay! I'll go look. I hope we still have some juice left. I'm really thirsty!"
mother,"If it's not there, just grab some water or something."
