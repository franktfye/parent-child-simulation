daughter,"Hey Dad, guess what? I got an A on my math test today! And you know what? It was all about fractions, and I remembered how you helped me with my homework last week. That really made a difference! Can we celebrate with some ice cream later? Please?"
father,"That's what I expect from you, to always perform at your best. Getting an A should be the norm, not the exception. We don't celebrate doing what you're supposed to do. Keep up the good work and stay focused on your studies. There will be no ice cream. There's more work to be done."
daughter,"Aw, but Dad, I worked really hard for that A! Can't we just get a little ice cream to celebrate? Just a tiny scoop? I promise I'll still stay focused on my studies, and it'll be like a little energy boost! Please?"
father,"No, we're not getting ice cream. You're expected to get good grades, and we don't celebrate simply for meeting expectations. Keep focusing on your studies. There's no need for a reward for doing what you're supposed to do."
daughter,"But Dad, I've been working really hard, and I got an A on that really tough math test! I know it's expected, but can't we just get a little ice cream as a treat? It doesn't have to be a big celebration, just something small to make the day special. Please?"
father,"Getting an A is exactly what you're supposed to do; it's your responsibility as a student. There's no need for extra rewards for fulfilling your duties. We have a schedule to stick to, and ice cream is not part of it. Keep focusing on your studies and maintain your grades; that's your priority. Now, please go and finish your homework."
daughter,"Aw, but Dad, I worked really hard for that A, and I thought maybe just this once we could celebrate with a little ice cream. Homework can wait just a little bit, can't it? I promise I'll still get it done on time! Plus, ice cream would be such a fun break! Please?"
father,"I appreciate that you worked hard and got an A, but you know the rules. Homework comes first, and there will be no exceptions. Ice cream is not a reward for doing what you are supposed to do. You can have dessert after dinner, as usual, once all your responsibilities have been taken care of. Now, please go and start your homework."
daughter,"But Dad, I did all my homework already, see? *holds up completed homework sheets* Can I have ice cream now since I finished everything? I really worked hard for that A, and I made sure to do my homework first like you always tell me to. Please?"
father,"I see that you have completed your homework, and I acknowledge your effort in getting that A. However, ice cream is not a reward for doing what is expected of you. You are supposed to do your homework and excel in school. That is your responsibility. Now, it's time to prepare for tomorrow. Ensure your school bag is packed and your uniform is ready. There will be no ice cream tonight. Discipline is key, and we do not bend the rules for treats."
daughter,"Aw, but Dad, I worked really hard and I thought maybe just this once we could celebrate a little. Can't we have just a tiny bit of ice cream? I promise I'll still be super ready for tomorrow, and I'll pack my bag extra carefully! Please?"
father,"I appreciate your dedication to your studies, but we will not be having ice cream tonight. Rewards are not given for fulfilling your basic duties. You must understand that achieving good grades is expected of you and not something out of the ordinary. Now, please focus on preparing for tomorrow. There will be no further discussion on this matter."
