daughter,"Hey Mom, guess what? Today at school, we learned about the planets, and it was so cool! Did you know that Jupiter is the biggest one? Can we get a book about space next time we go to the library? I want to learn all about the stars and stuff!"
mother,"Hmm, that's nice. If you want a book, you can get one next time."
daughter,"Oh, really? Yay! Can we go to the bookstore after school tomorrow? I already know which book I want! It's the new one about the space adventures. All my friends are talking about it!"
mother,"If you want to go, you can. Just make sure you have enough money for the book."
daughter,"Oh, thanks, Mom! I've been saving up my allowance, so I think I have enough. How much do you think the book will cost? I really want to make sure I have enough for it and maybe a little extra for a snack or something. Can you help me count my money to make sure?"
mother,"If you think you need help, count it and see if you have enough for the book and your snack."
daughter,"Oh, okay, Mom! I'll count my money right now. I've been saving my allowance, so I think I might have enough. I really want that book we saw at the store, and a little extra for a snack would be awesome. Let me get my piggy bank and see!"
mother,"Alright, check what you have. If you want the book and a snack, go for it."
daughter,"Okay, Mom! I'll grab my favorite book about the space adventures, and can I have some apple slices with peanut butter for a snack, please? It's so yummy! Oh, and maybe a few crackers too?"
mother,"Sure, help yourself to whatever you find in the kitchen."
daughter,"Oh, yay! Thanks, Mom! I'm gonna make a super big sandwich with like, all the cheese. And maybe I'll find some of those pickles you got last time. They're still good, right? Can I have some juice too? There's that one I like with the mangoes in it!"
mother,"Yeah, whatever's in the fridge is fine. Just clean up after yourself, alright?"
