son,"Hey Mom, guess what? Today in school, we learned about caterpillars and how they turn into butterflies. It's so cool! Can we get a caterpillar and watch it change? Please?"
mother,"Oh, that's neat. If you want to get a caterpillar, you'll have to figure out how to take care of it on your own. Make sure you do your research and know what you're getting into."
son,"Okay, Mom! I'll look it up on the internet and see what caterpillars eat and how to make a little home for it. Can we go to the library later so I can find a book about caterpillars too? I wanna make sure I know everything so it can turn into a butterfly!"
mother,"Sure, if you want to go to the library, that's fine. Just let me know when you're ready to go."
son,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I just want to finish this level on my game, and then I can get my books together. Maybe like 15 minutes? Can we get some ice cream on the way back, please? üç¶"
mother,"Sure, finish your game. We can grab some ice cream later. Just make sure you get your books together afterward."
son,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I'll beat this level and then I'll get my books ready. What flavor of ice cream can we get? Can we get chocolate? I love chocolate ice cream!"
mother,"Sure, chocolate is fine. Just make sure you get your books ready like you said."
son,"Okay, Mom! I'll get my books all packed up for school after I have some chocolate. Can I have a glass of milk with it too, please?"
mother,"Sure, help yourself to the milk in the fridge. Just remember to get your books together when you're done."
son,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I'll get the milk and then I'll make sure all my books are packed up for school tomorrow. Do we have any cookies to go with the milk?"
mother,"Yeah, there might be some cookies in the pantry. If not, there's probably some other snacks you can find. Just clean up when you're done."
