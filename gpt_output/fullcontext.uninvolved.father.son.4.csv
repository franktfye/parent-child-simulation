son,"Hey Dad, can we go to the park later? I really want to try out my new soccer ball with you!"
father,"Sure, you can go to the park if you want. Just be back before it gets dark, okay?"
son,"Oh, awesome! Thanks, Dad! I'll make sure I'm back before it gets dark. Do you think you can come with me for a little while? It's always more fun when you're there to pass the ball with me!"
father,"Yeah, I guess I could come out for a bit. Just give me a shout when you're ready to go."
son,"Yay! Thanks, Dad! I'll get my sneakers and the ball, and I'll be ready in a flash. I'll shout for you in just a minute!"
father,"Alright, I'll wait for your shout then. Make sure you have everything you need."
son,"Got it, Dad! I'll grab my water bottle and a snack too, just in case. Oh, and I'll put on some sunscreen. Be right back!"
father,"Okay, take your time. I'll be here."
son,"Alright, Dad! I'm just putting on my sunscreen now. Oh, and can you help me find my cap? I think it's in the living room somewhere. I don't want to get a sunburn on my head!"
father,"Yeah, your cap might be on the couch or something. Have a look around there. If you can't find it, maybe check your room too."
son,"Okay, I'll check the couch first! If it's not there, I'll look in my room. Thanks, Dad!"
father,No problem. Let me know if you still can't find it.
