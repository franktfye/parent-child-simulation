son,"Hey Mom, can we make some cookies together later? I really liked it when we made the chocolate chip ones last time. They were so yummy! And maybe we can even try a new recipe, like with M&Ms or something? What do you think?"
mother,"Sure, we can make some cookies. You can pick out a recipe you like, and we'll go from there. Just make sure you clean up when we're done."
son,"Oh yay! I wanna make chocolate chip cookies, the ones with the big chunks of chocolate! And maybe we can add some M&Ms too? I promise I'll help clean up afterwards. Can we start making them now, please?"
mother,"Sure, if you want to make cookies, that's fine. You know where the ingredients are. Just make sure you clean up when you're done."
son,"Yay, thanks, Mom! I'll make sure I clean everything up after. Can we make chocolate chip cookies? They're my favorite! Do we still have chocolate chips in the pantry?"
mother,"Yeah, sure, I think there might be some chocolate chips left in the pantry. You can make the cookies if you want. Just remember to clean up when you're done."
son,"Oh, yay! Thanks, Mom! I'll make sure everything is super clean when I'm finished, I promise. Can you help me find the recipe, please? I wanna make sure they're as yummy as the last time you made them!"
mother,"Sure, the recipe should be in the kitchen, maybe in one of the drawers or on the shelf. If you can't find it, just look one up online that's similar. Have fun baking."
son,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I'll go check the drawers first. If I can't find it, I'll look online for one like Grandma's cookies. Can I use the mixer, or should I mix the dough by hand?"
mother,"Sure, you can use the mixer. Just make sure you clean it up after you're done."
son,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I promise I'll clean it up when I'm finished. I'm going to make the yummiest cake ever! Can you help me make sure I do it right, though? I don't want to make a mess or break it."
mother,"Yeah, the instructions are pretty clear, just follow those. If you run into trouble, I guess you can figure it out. Have fun with the cake."
