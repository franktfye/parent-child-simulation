daughter,Hey Dad! Guess what? I scored the winning goal in soccer today! It was so cool. Everyone was cheering. Can we get some ice cream to celebrate? Please?
father,"That's good, you're expected to do well when you commit to an activity. But remember, we have rules about sweets and treats. You know we only have desserts on the weekends. Today is not the day for ice cream. Keep focusing on your practice, and we'll stick to our schedule."
daughter,"Aw, but Dad, I've been practicing really hard today. Can't we make a little exception? I promise I'll still eat all my veggies at dinner! Please? Just a little scoop of ice cream?"
father,"No, we cannot make an exception today. You know the rules: dessert is only on weekends. Keep up with your practice, and remember to eat all your vegetables at dinner. Now, let's not have any more discussions about this."
daughter,"Aw, but Dad, I was really hoping for just a little piece of cake today. I've been doing so well with my homework and chores, doesn't that count for something? Plus, I promise I'll eat all my veggies, even the broccoli! Can't we make it a special day, pretty please?"
father,"No, you may not have cake today. You are expected to do well with your homework and chores as part of your responsibilities. Eating your vegetables is also non-negotiable. We do not reward expected behavior with treats. The rules are clear and there will be no exceptions. Now, please finish your dinner."
daughter,"But Dad, I've been doing really good with my homework and chores all week! And I always eat my veggies, even the green beans that I don't like much. Can't I have just a little piece of cake? Just a teeny tiny one? It smells so yummy and I promise I'll still do great with my homework! Please?"
father,"No, you may not have cake now. You know the rules: sweets are only for special occasions. Your responsibilities like homework and chores are expected of you and should be done without expecting extra rewards. Now, please finish your dinner without any further discussion about this."
daughter,"But daaad, I ate all my veggies, and my homework is all done! Can't we make today a special occasion? Please? I'll even do extra chores tomorrow!"
father,"No, today is not a special occasion. You've done what is expected of you, and that's good, but it doesn't warrant a change in the rules or routine. There will be no extra time for leisure activities today. You can do extra chores tomorrow if you wish, but that is a separate matter and does not influence today's schedule. Now, please make sure you've finished everything you need to do, and get ready for bed at the usual time."
daughter,"But Dad, I really worked hard today and I finished all my homework and cleaned my room. Can't we make just a little exception for today? Maybe we could watch one episode of my favorite show together or have a little extra time to read my new book? Please? I promise I'll go to bed without any fuss right after."
father,"I appreciate your efforts today, but rules are rules. There will be no exceptions. You've done your homework and cleaned your room as you're supposed to. That is your responsibility. Now, it's time to stick to the routine. Go and get ready for bed. There will be no more discussion on this matter. Goodnight."
