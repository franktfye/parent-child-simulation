daughter,"Hey Mom, guess what happened at school today! We had an art class and I drew a picture of our family. The teacher said it was really good and she's going to put it on the bulletin board for everyone to see! Can we get some ice cream later to celebrate?"
mother,"Sure, we can get ice cream."
daughter,"Yay! Thank you, Mommy! Can I get chocolate flavor this time? And maybe sprinkles on top? Oh, and can we sit on the bench outside the shop while we eat? It's such a nice day!"
mother,"Yeah, sure. Get whatever you want."
daughter,"Really?! Awesome! Thanks, Mom! I'm gonna get the biggest scoop of chocolate ice cream with extra sprinkles! And maybe I can try a little bit of strawberry too? Can I, please? It's gonna be the best ice cream celebration ever!"
mother,"Yeah, get whatever flavors you want."
daughter,"Yay! You're the best, Mom! I'm gonna mix chocolate and strawberry and make it a super-duper ice cream sundae! Can we also get some whipped cream on it? And a cherry on top, pretty please with sugar on it? It's gonna look like a mountain of yumminess!"
mother,"Sure, get whatever toppings you want."
daughter,"Woohoo! I'm gonna have a mountain of sprinkles then! And maybe some gummy bears too if they have them. It's gonna be like a party in a cup! Thanks, Mom! You're the best! Can we go after school tomorrow?"
mother,"Yeah, sure. We can go after school."
daughter,"Oh, yay! After school is perfect 'cause then I'll have all my homework done and it'll be like a super awesome reward! Can we invite Sarah too? She's been really nice helping me with math and I promised her we'd get ice cream together sometime!"
mother,"Sure, you can invite Sarah. Just make sure you've got all your homework done like you said."
