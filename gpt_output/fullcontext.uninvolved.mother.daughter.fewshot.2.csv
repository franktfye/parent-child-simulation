daughter,"Hey Mom, can we make some cookies later? I really want to try making the chocolate chip ones like we saw on that cooking show! It looked so fun, and I want to help with the mixing and everything. Can we, please?"
mother,"Sure, if you want to make cookies, go ahead."
daughter,"Yay! Thank you, Mom! I'll get the recipe ready. Oh, and can you help me find the cookie cutters? I want to make some in the shape of stars and hearts!"
mother,The cookie cutters? They might be in one of the kitchen drawers. Check there.
daughter,"Okay, I'll go look for them! I hope I can find the star and heart ones. They're gonna make the cookies look so cute!"
mother,"Yeah, they should be in the drawer. If you can't find them, they might be somewhere else in the kitchen."
daughter,"I found them, Mom! The star and heart cutters were right at the back of the drawer. They were hiding behind the rolling pin. We're all set now! When can we start making the cookies? I can't wait to mix the dough and see them bake!"
mother,You can start whenever you want.
daughter,Awesome! I'll get all the ingredients out on the counter. Can you help me make sure I measure everything right? I want the cookies to be perfect!
mother,"If you need help, just ask."
daughter,"Okay, thanks, Mom! I'll try to do it by myself first, but I'll definitely ask if I'm not sure about something. Let's make the best cookies ever!"
mother,"Alright, have fun with it."
